## Inspiration
One in four people in the world are affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives. Around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill-health and disability worldwide.

## What it does
It allows people to learn about mental health, connect with people going through the same as well as talk to a therapist.

## How we built it
I used the repl.it editor where we mainly used HTML and CSS to create the informative side of the website. Like the home, therapist, podcast, and book pages. Then I moved on to creating features that included JavaScript and integration of firebase. For the chat app, I used PHP to create it.

## Challenges we ran into
During this hackathon, I faced a lot of challenges including technical problems. One of them was creating the chat app using PHP but in the end, I did it successfully.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Some of the accomplishments that I'm proud of include the basic information to creating a chat app with PHP, integrating firebase. It was totally a lot of stressful but successful work.

## What we learned
I learned that it is important to focus more on quantity than quality sometimes.

## What's next for MentalBeing
Since this is not the best version of MentalBeing we will keep updating it.
